# easy_cts_archive

An example of a CTS archive composed of editions only in markdown and delimited text files.

It is automatically included in an "Easy CTS Virtual Machine" (available from <https://github.com/neelsmith/easy_cts_vm>) if you want to try a preassembled CTS system.  The file `manager-conf.gradle` configures  `cite-archive-manager` to use this archive in the VM:  if you want to use `cite-archive-manager` in your own  system, change the literal paths to correct values for your machine.
