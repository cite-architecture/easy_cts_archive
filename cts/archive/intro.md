# Easy CTS archive

This archive illustrates how texts in three minimal formats can be used with a working CTS service.  Information about how each text is canonically cited is cataloged in the file `easytextinventory.xml`.  The accompanying file `easytextconfig.xml` documents how the canonical citation scheme has been implemented.

The document you are reading is written in "bare markdown." Using the `citemgr` utility, you can create a citable version of this document that interprets markdown headers as hierarchical divisions, and markdown block elements as succesive citable nodes.

The archive includes two versions of the Dutch text of Anne Frank's diary, *Het Achterhuis* (in the public domain as of Jan. 1, 2016). `achterhuis_2cols.txt` is a an ordered list pairing citable URNs with the text of each citable node.  `achterhuis_82XF.txt` is a delimited text file in the OHCO2 eXchange Format.
